## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel very confident on the basic logic behind them, learning the specific methods will likely take time and repetition.
## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I will likely see what my small group compatriots have done with their arrays to see if their perspectives or methods were different than mine, and if there's any troubleshooting or improvements to be added to my own.
## What questions do you have about Arrays?
I did see in my VS Code editor that when I hovered parts of the method code that `Array<number>` popped up in the preview, so I will be curious to see what happens when multiple arrays are being juggled.
